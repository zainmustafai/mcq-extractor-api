1. A dice is tossed 120 times with the following results

No. turned up	1	2	3	4	5	6
Frequency	30	25	18	10	22	15
Test the hypothesis that the dice is unbiased (X2 = 11.7). Calculate the frequency observed for Chi Square distribution.
a) Dice is unbiased, 11.3
b) Dice is biased, 12.9
c) Dice is unbiased, 10.9
d) Dice is biased, 12.3
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Step 1: Null Hypothesis: dice is unbiased.
Step 2: Calculation of Expected frequency:
Since the dice is unbiased P(r) = 1/6.
r = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Expected frequency f(r) = N*r = 120* 1/6 = 20
Step3: Calculation of X2
X2 \(=∑\frac{[(fe-fo)]^2}{fe} \)
Hence X2 = 12.90 > 11.90.
Thus dice is biased.

5. A bag contains 80 chocolates. This bag has 4 different colors of chocolates in it. If all four colors of chocolates were equally likely to be put in the bag, what would be the expected number of chocolates of each color?
a) 12
b) 11
c) 20
d) 9
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: If all four colors were equally likely to be put in the bag, then the expected frequency for a given color would be 1/4th of the chocolates.
N = 80, r = 1/4
So, the expected frequency = N*r = (1/4)*(80) = 20.
6. Suppose a person has 8 red, 5 green, 12 orange, and 15 blue balls. Test the null hypothesis that the colors of the balls occur with equal frequency. What is the Chi Square value you get?
a) 5.6
b) 5.68
c) 5.86
d) 5.8
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: By Chi Square Test we get,
Observed frequency f0= (8+5+12+15)/4 = 10
X2 =\(∑\frac{[(fe-fo)]^2}{fe} \)
The sum of each (expected – observed)2/expected = (10-8)2/10 + (10-5)2/10 + (10-12)2/10 + (10-15)2/10 = 5.8.
7. A faculty is interested in whether there is a relationship between gender and subject at his college.

a) 31.12
b) 11.32
c) 12.13
d) 13.12
View Answer

1) Do you drink?
2) Are you in favor of local option sale of Liquor

Yes	No	Total
Yes	56	31	87
No	18	6	24
Total	74	37	111
Infer or not the local option on the sale of liquor is dependent on individual drinker? Find the value of X2 for degrees of freedom at level of significance 3.841.
a) 0.957
b) 0.975
c) 0.759
d) 0.795
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Step 1: Null hypothesis: The option on the sale of liquor is not dependent with the individual drinking.
Step 2: Calculation of theoretical frequencies (Expected)
Expected frequency of (1,1) cell
fe11 = 87*74/111 = 58
fe12 = 87*37/111 = 29
fe21 = 24*74/111 = 16
fe22 = 24*32/111 = 8
Step 3: calculation of X2 distribution we know that
X2 =\( ∑\frac{[(fe-fo)]^2}{fe} \)
X2 = 0.957 < 3.841.
Hence the null hypothesis is accepted
Thus the sale of liquor does not depend on the individual drinker.

Men	30	35
Women	50	45
a) 2.68
b) 1.34
c) 1.68
d) 1.34
View Answer

where σ1 is the standard deviation of population 1
s1 is the standard deviation of the sample drawn from population 1
σ2 is the standard deviation of population 2
s1 is the standard deviation of the sample drawn from population 2.
f = (352/302)/(452/502)
f = (1225/900)/(2025/2500)
f = 1.361/0.81 = 1.68.

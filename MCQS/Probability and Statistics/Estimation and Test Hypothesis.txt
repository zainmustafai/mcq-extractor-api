Answer: a
Explanation: In Testing of Hypothesis Type 1 error occurs when we reject H0 if it is True. On the contrary a Type 2 error occurs when we accept H0 if it is False.

a) 1-α
b) β
c) α
d) 1-β
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In Testing of Hypothesis Type 1 error occurs when we reject H0 if it is True. The probability of H0 is α then the error probability will be 1- α.
15. Alternative Hypothesis is also called as?
a) Composite hypothesis
b) Research Hypothesis
c) Simple Hypothesis
d) Null Hypothesis
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Alternative Hypothesis is also called as Research Hypothesis. If the Null Hypothesis is false then Alternative Hypothesis is accepted.

1. What is the assumption made for performing the hypothesis test with T distribution?
a) the distribution is non-symmetric
b) the distribution has more than one modal class
c) the distribution has a constant variance
d) the distribution follows a normal distribution
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: For testing of Hypothesis with T distribution it is assumed that the distribution follows a normal distribution. The region is identified and hence based on the normal variate Hypothesis is accepted or rejected.
2. If a hypothesis is rejected at 0.6 Level of Significance then ______________
a) it will be rejected at any level
b) it must be rejected at 0.5 level
c) it may be rejected at 0.5 level
d) it cannot be rejected at 0.5 level
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: If the hypothesis is rejected at 0.6 Level of Significance then p < 0.6. Hence p can be less than 0.5 also. Therefore it may be rejected at 0.5 Level of Significance.
3. In a two tailed test when a Null Hypothesis is rejected for a True Alternative Hypothesis then it has ____________
a) Type 1 error
b) Type 2 error
c) No error
d) Many errors
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In Testing of Hypothesis Type 1 error occurs when we reject a true Null Hypothesis. On the contrary a Type 2 error occurs when we accept a false Null Hypothesis. Hence if the Alternative Hypothesis is true and Null Hypothesis is rejected then no error occurs.

4. In a hypothesis test, what does the p value signify?
a) smallest level of significance for rejection of Null Hypothesis
b) largest level of significance for rejection of Null Hypothesis
c) smallest level of significance for acceptance of Null Hypothesis
d) smallest level of significance for acceptance of Null Hypothesis
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: In a Hypothesis, the p value signifies the smallest level of significance for rejection of Null Hypothesis. Below this value, for every value the hypothesis is rejected.
5. A Null Hypothesis has Level of Significance 9%. For what values of Level of Significances it will be rejected?
a) 0.99
b) 0.009
c) 0.099
d) 0.9
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: The Level of Significance of Null Hypothesis is 0.09. Hence the hypothesis will be rejected at values less than 0.09.

a) a guilty person is set free
b) an innocent person is convicted
c) a guilty person is convicted
d) an innocent person is set free
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Type 1 error occurs when the Null hypothesis is True but rejected. Considering Null hypothesis as innocent person and setting free as acceptance an innocent person getting convicted is a type 1 error.

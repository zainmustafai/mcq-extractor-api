1. Which unit is responsible for converting the data received from the user into a computer understandable format?
a) Memory Unit
b) Arithmetic & Logic Unit
c) Input Unit
d) Output Unit
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The Input Unit converts the data, which the user enters into a language which the computer understands, i.e. it converts the data into binary format. The Output Unit is responsible for giving the results in user-understandable format. The Storage Unit is responsible for storing the data after immediate results of processing whereas; the ALU is responsible for various arithmetic and bitwise operations.

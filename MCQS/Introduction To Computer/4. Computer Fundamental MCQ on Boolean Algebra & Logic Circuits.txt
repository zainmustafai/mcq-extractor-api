1. The number of values applicable in Boolean Algebra.
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Boolean algebra is based on binary number system. It therefore comprises only 2 bits : 0 and 1. Hence, only two values are applicable to Boolean algebra.
2. Boolean Algebra can deal with any number system.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Boolean Algebra can only be used with the binary number system. Boolean deals with only two values 0 and 1. In Boolean System, if the result is tautology it returns 1 otherwise 0.

6. Which of the following is false?
a) x+y=y+x
b) x.y=y.x
c) x.x’=1
d) x+x’=1
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The first and second option describes the commutative law. The fourth option holds true since if x=1, then x’=0, and x+x’=1. Third option is incorrect because on multiplication of a boolean value with its complement the result will always be 0.
7. As per idempotent law, X + X will always be equal to ________
a) 0
b) 1
c) X
d) 2X
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: It will always return the same value X. Since, boolean deals with only two numbers 0 and 1, if we add 0+0, the answer is 0. Similarly, if we add 1+1 the answer is 1.

1. Which of the following is not a type of number system?
a) Positional
b) Non-Positional
c) Octal
d) Fractional
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: There are two main types of number systems : Positional & Non-positional.
Positional System uses digits for the representation whereas, non-positional number systems use certain symbols for the representation of numbers. Octal is a type of positional number systems with base 8.
2. How is the number 5 represented in non-positional number system?
a) IIIII
b) 5
c) V
d) v
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In a non-positional number system, 1 is represented as I, 2 as II, 3 as III, 4 as IIII and therefore, 5 is represented as V in Roman Code. The digits in this number system are represented by symbols.
3. The base is the total number of digits in a number system.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The statement is true. In a positional number system, base is the number of digits the system comprises. For example, a binary number system comprises of only 2 digits, 0 and 1, therefore its base is 2. Similarly, the decimal system comprises 10 digits 0 to 9, therefore its base is 10.

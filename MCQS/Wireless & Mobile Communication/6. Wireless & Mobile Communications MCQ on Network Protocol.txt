4. Checksum is used in Internet by several protocols although not at the _________
a) Session layer
b) Transport layer
c) Network layer
d) Data link layer

5. In version field of IPv4 header, when machine is using some other version of IPv4 then datagram is __________
a) Discarded
b) Accepted
c) Interpreted
d) Interpreted incorrectly
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: A 4 bit field defines the version of IPv4 protocol. This field tells the software running in the processing machine that the datagram has the format of version 4. If the machine is using some other version of IPv4, the datagram is discarded rather than interpreted incorrectly.

a) Fixed length
b) Variable length
c) Global length
d) Zero length
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: ‘IPv4 is a connectionless protocol used for packet switched networks. It operates on best effort delivery model, in which neither delivery is guaranteed, nor proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate delivery is assured. The size of the datagram header can be of variable length from 20 bytes to 60 bytes.’

1. IPv6 has a larger address space of _________
a) 216
b) 2128
c) 232
d) 28
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: The main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4. The address space therefore has 2128 or approximately 3.4×1038 addresses.

6. Which one of the following descriptions about IPv6 is correct?
a) Addresses are not hierarchical and are assigned at random
b) Broadcasts have been eliminated and replaced with multicasts
c) There are 2.7 billion available addresses
d) An interface can only be configured with one IPv6 address

Answer: b
Explanation: In IPv6, there’s no longer any broadcast, sending one packet to a large number of unspecified hosts. There’s only multicast, unicast and anycast. In IPv6 all nodes are required to support multicast.
7. The header length of an IPv6 datagram is ___________
a) 10bytes
b) 25bytes
c) 30bytes
d) 40bytes
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: IPv6 datagram has fixed header length of 40bytes. It results in faster processing of the datagram. Fixed length IPv6 header allows the routers to process the IPv6 datagram packets more efficiently.
8. In the IPv6 header, the traffic class field is similar to which field in the IPv4 header?
a) Fragmentation field
b) Fast switching
c) TOS field
d) Option field
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: This field enables to have different types of IP datagram. In an IPv6 packet, the Traffic Class byte is used in the same way as the ToS byte in an IPv4 packet. A ToS/Traffic Class byte includes a DSCP (Differentiated Services Codepoint) and precedence bits.
9. Which are the features present in IPv4 but not in IPv6?
a) Fragmentation
b) Header checksum
c) Options
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: All the features are only present in IPv4 and not IPv6. IPv6 no longer has a header checksum to protect the IP header, meaning that when a packet header is corrupted by transmission errors, the packet is very likely to be delivered incorrectly.
10. IPv6 is designed to allow extension of the _________
a) Protocol
b) Dataset
c) Headers
d) Routes
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: IPv6 is designed to allow the extension of the protocol if required by new technologies or applications. IPv6 uses a new header format in which options are separated from the base header and inserted, when needed, between the base header and upper-layer data.
11. In IPv6, base header can be followed by, up to _________
a) Six Extension Layers
b) Six Extension Headers
c) Eight Extension headers
d) Eight Extension layers
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: The length of the base header is 40 bytes. However, to give more functionality to the IP datagram, the base header can be followed by up to six extension headers.
12. In an IPv6 datagram, M bit is 0, value of HLEN is 5, value of total length is 200 and offset value is ___________
a) 400
b) 350
c) 300
d) 200
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: In an IPv6 datagram, M bit is 0, value of HLEN is 5, the value of total length is 200 and offset value is 200. If the M bit is 0, it means there are no more fragments, the fragment is the last name.

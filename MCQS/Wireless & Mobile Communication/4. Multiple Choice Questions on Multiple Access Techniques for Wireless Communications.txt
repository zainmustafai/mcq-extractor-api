6. Time division duplexing uses ________ to provide both a forward and reverse link.
a) Frequency
b) Time
c) Time and frequency
d) Cell spacing
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Time division duplexing (TDD) uses time instead of frequency to provide both a forward and reverse link. In TDD, multiple users share a single radio channel by taking turns in the time domain.
7. TDD is effective for _________
a) Fixed wireless access and users are stationary
b) Dynamic wireless access and users are stationary
c) Fixed wireless access and users are moving
d) Dynamic wireless access and users are moving
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: TDD is effective for fixed wireless access when all users are stationary. This makes the propagation delay does not vary in time among the users. Because of rigid timing required for time slotting, TDD generally is limited to cordless phone or short range potable access.
8. In wideband systems, the transmission bandwidth of a single channel _________ coherence bandwidth of the channel.
a) Equal to
b) Not related to
c) Larger than
d) Smaller than
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In wideband systems, the transmission bandwidth of a single channel is much larger than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. Thus, multipath fading does not greatly vary the received signal power within a wideband channel.
9. In narrowband system, the channels are usually operated using TDD.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: In narrowband system, channels are usually operated using FDD. To minimize interference between forward and reverse links on each channel, the frequency separation is made as great as possible within the frequency spectrum.

a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: In narrowband FDMA, a user is assigned a particular channel which is not shared by other users in the vicinity. However narrowband TDMA allows the users to share the same radio channel allocating a unique time slot to each user.
1. Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) assigns ______ channels to _______ users.
a) Individual, individual
b) Many, individual
c) Individual, many
d) Many, many
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) assigns individual channels to individual users. Each user is allocated a unique frequency band or channel. These channels are assigned on demand to users who request service.
2. During the period of call, other users can share the same channel in FDMA.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: In FDMA systems, no other user can share the same channel during the period of call. In FDD systems, the users are assigned a channel as a pair of frequencies; one is used for the forward channel while the other frequency is used for the reverse channel.
3. The FDMA channel carries ____________ phone circuit at a time.
a) Ten
b) Two
c) One
d) Several
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The FDMA channel carries one phone circuit at a time. Each individual band or channel is wide enough to accommodate the signal spectra of the transmissions to be propagated.

6. The symbol time in FDMA systems is _________ thus intersymbol interference is ______
a) Large, high
b) Small, low
c) Small, high
d) Large, low

a) Low complexity
b) Lower cell site system cost
c) Tight RF filtering
d) Narrow bandwidth
View Answer

9. __________ is undesired RF radiation.
a) Intermodulation frequency
b) Intermediate frequency
c) Instantaneous frequency
d) Instrumental frequency
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Intermodulation (IM) frequency is undesired RF radiation which can interfere with other channels in the FDMA systems. The nonlinearities cause signal spreading in the frequency domain and generate IM frequency.

a) Preamble
b) Data
c) Guard bits
d) Trail bits
View Answer

Answer: c

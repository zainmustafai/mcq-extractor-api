1. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become an effective standard for software modelling.How many different notations does it have ?
a) Three
b) Four
c) Six
d) Nine
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The different notations of UML includes the nine UML diagrams namely class, object, sequence, collaboration, activity, state-chart, component, deployment and use case diagrams.
2. Which model in system modelling depicts the dynamic behaviour of the system ?
a) Context Model
b) Behavioral Model
c) Data Model
d) Object Model
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Behavioral models are used to describe the dynamic behavior of an executing system. This can be modeled from the perspective of the data processed by the system or by the events that stimulate responses from a system.
3. Which model in system modelling depicts the static nature of the system ?
a) Behavioral Model
b) Context Model
c) Data Model
d) Structural Model
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Structural models show the organization and architecture of a system. These are used to define the static structure of classes in a system and their associations.

6. Activity diagrams are used to model the processing of data.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The statement mentioned is true and each activity represents one process step.
7. Model-driven engineering is just a theoretical concept. It cannot be converted into a working/executable code.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Model-driven engineering is an approach to software development in which a system is represented as a set of models that can be automatically transformed to executable code.
8. The UML supports event-based modeling using ____________ diagrams.
a) Deployment
b) Collaboration
c) State chart
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: State diagrams show system states and events that cause transitions from one state to another.
1. Which of the following diagram is not supported by UML considering Data-driven modeling ?
a) Activity
b) Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
c) State Chart
d) Component
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: DFDs focus on system functions and do not recognize system objects.
2. _________________ allows us to infer that different members of classes have some common characteristics.
a) Realization
b) Aggregation
c) Generalization
d) dependency
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Generalization is an everyday technique that we use to manage complexity.This means that common information will be maintained in one place only.
3. One creates Behavioral models of a system when you are discussing and designing the system architecture.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Structural models of software display the organization of a system in terms of the components that make up that system and their relationships.

4. ______________ & ______________ diagrams of UML represent Interaction modeling.
a) Use Case, Sequence
b) Class, Object
c) Activity, State Chart
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Use case modeling is mostly used to model interactions between a system and external actors.Sequence diagrams are used to model interactions between system components, although external agents may also be included.
5. Which level of Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) models all entities and relationships ?
a) Level 1
b) Level 2
c) Level 3
d) Level 4
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Level 1 ERD models all data objects (entities) and their “connections” to one another while Level 3 ERD models all entities, relationships, and the attributes that provide further depth. Thus option b is correct.

7. Which of the following statement is incorrect regarding the Class-responsibility-collaborator (CRC) modeling ?
a) All use-case scenarios (and corresponding use-case diagrams) are organized into categories in CRC modelling
b) The review leader reads the use-case deliberately
c) Only developers in the review (of the CRC model) are given a subset of the CRC model index cards
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: All participants in the review (of the CRC model) are given a subset of the CRC model index cards.
8. A data object can encapsulates processes and operation as well.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: A data object encapsulates data only. There is no reference within a data object to operations that act on the data.

1. The two dimensions of spiral model are
a) diagonal, angular
b) radial, perpendicular
c) radial, angular
d) diagonal, perpendicular
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The radial dimension depicts the cumulative costs and the angular dimension depicts the progress made in completing each cycle. Each loop of the spiral model represents a phase.
2. The Incremental Model is combination of elements of
a) Build & FIX Model & Waterfall Model
b) Linear Model & RAD Model
c) Linear Model & Prototyping Model
d) Waterfall Model & RAD Model
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Each linear sequence produces a deliverable “increment” of the software system, particularly needed in case of quick delivery of a limited functionality system..
3. Model preferred to create client/server applications is
a) WINWIN Spiral Model
b) Spiral Model
c) Concurrent Model
d) Incremental Model
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In case of client/server applications, the concurrent process model specifies activities in two dimensions: a system dimension and a component dimension. Hence Concurrency is achieved by these two activities occurring simultaneously and can be modeled using the state-oriented approach.

10. Reverse engineering is the last activity in a reengineering project.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Reverse engineering is often the initial activity in a reengineering project.
11. The cost of re-engineering is often significantly less than the costs of developing new software.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: There is a high risk in new software development. There may be development problems, staffing problems and specification problems, thereby increasing the cost.

View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Each linear sequence produces a deliverable “increment” of the software and particularly when we have to quickly deliver a limited functionality system.
3. What is the major advantage of using Incremental Model?
a) Customer can respond to each increment
b) Easier to test and debug
c) It is used when there is a need to get a product to the market early
d) Easier to test and debug & It is used when there is a need to get a product to the market early
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Incremental Model is generally easier to test and debug than other methods of software development because relatively smaller changes are made during each iteration and is popular particularly when we have to quickly deliver a limited functionality system.However, option “a” can be seen in other models as well like RAD model,hence option “d” answers the question.

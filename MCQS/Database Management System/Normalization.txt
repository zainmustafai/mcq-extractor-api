a) BCNF algorithm
b) 2NF algorithm
c) 3NF synthesis algorithm
d) 1NF algorithm

a) Zero
b) More than zero but less than that of an equivalent 3NF decomposition

9. A table has fields F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5, with the following functional dependencies:

F1->F3
F2->F4
(F1,F2)->F5
in terms of normalization, this table is in
a) 1NF
b) 2NF
c) 3NF
d) None of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Since the primary key is not given we have to derive the primary key of the table. Using the closure set of attributes we get the primary key as (F1, F2). From functional dependencies, “F1->F3, F2->F4”, we can see that there is partial functional dependency therefore it is not in 1NF. Hence the table is in 1NF.
10. Let R(A,B,C,D,E,P,G) be a relational schema in which the following FDs are known to hold:

AB->CD
DE->P
C->E
P->C

a) in BCNF
b) in 3NF, but not in BCNF
c) in 2NF, but not in 3NF
d) not in 2NF
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: From the closure set of attributes we can see that the key for the relation is AB. The FD B->G is a partial dependency, hence it is not in 2NF.This set of Database Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Functional-Dependency Theory”.

6. Which of the following is the comparison operator in tuple relational calculus
a) ⇒
b) =
c) ε
d) All of the mentioned

7. An expression in the domain relational calculus is of the form
a) {P(x1, x2, . . . , xn) | < x1, x2, . . . , xn > }
b) {x1, x2, . . . , xn | < x1, x2, . . . , xn > }
c) { x1, x2, . . . , xn | x1, x2, . . . , xn}
d) {< x1, x2, . . . , xn > | P(x1, x2, . . . , xn)}
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Here x1, x2, . . . , xn represent domain variables. P represents a formula composed of atoms, as was the case in the tuple relational calculus.

∧s = “Spring” ∧ y = “2010”
b)

{< n, c > | Э i, a (< i, c, a, s, y > ε teaches
∧ Э d, s (< i, n, d, s > ε instructor ∧ d = “Physics”))}
c)

{< n > | Э i, d, s (< i, n, d, s > ε instructor ∧ s > 80000)}

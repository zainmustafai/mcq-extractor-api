4. What is the bit rate for high-definition TV (HDTV)?
a) 1.4 Gbps
b) 2 Gbps
c) 1.5 Gbps
d) 1.8 Gbps
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation:
The HDTV screen is normally a ratio of 16: 9 (in contrast to 4: 3 for regular TV)
There are 1920 by 1080 pixels per screen, and
Screen is renewed 30 times per second.
24-bits represent one color pixel.
Therefore Bit Rate = 1920 × 1080 × 30 × 24 = 1,492992,000 = 1.5 Gbps.

7. We need to send 265 kbps over a noiseless channel with a bandwidth of 20 kHz. How many signal levels do we need?
a) 1024
b) 512
c) 256
d) 128
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation:
256000 = 2 × 20000 × log L = 6.625.
L = 98.7 Levels.
Since this result is not a power of 2, we need to either increase the number of levels or reduce the bit rate. If we have 128 levels, the bit rate is 280 kbps.

11. A channel has a 1-MHz bandwidth. The SNR for this channel is 63. What is the appropriate signel level?
a) 2
b) 8
c) 4
d) 16
View Answer

Explanation: As a continuation to the previous question where we get the channel capacity as 6 Mbps. For better performance we choose 4 Mbps. Thus we calculate L from –
4Mbps = 2 x 1 MHz x logL.
12. The appropriate signel level is 4 if SNR for this channel is 63

1. A pure ALOHA network transmits 200-bit frames on a shared channel of 200 kbps. What is the requirement to make this frame collision-free?
a) 2msec
b) 4msec
c) 2sec
d) 4sec
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Average frame transmission time
Tfr = 200 bits/200 kbps or 1 ms
Vulnerable time = 2x Tfr = 2 × 1 ms = 2 ms.
2. A pure ALOHA network transmits 200-bit frames on a shared channel of 200 kbps. What is the throughput if the system (all stations together) produces 1000 frames per second?
a) 150 frames
b) 80 frames
c) 135 frames
d) 96 frames
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Frame transmission time
Tfr= 200/200 kbps or 1 ms.
If the system creates 1000 frames per second, or 1 frame
per millisecond, then G = 1
S = G × e−2G = 0.135 (13.5 percent)
This means that,
Throughput =1000 × 0.135 = 135 frames.
3. A pure ALOHA network transmits 200-bit frames on a shared channel of 200 kbps. What is the throughput if the system (all stations together) produces 500 frames per second?
a) 146 frames
b) 92 frames
c) 38 frames
d) 156 frames
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: If the system creates 500 frames per second, or 1/2 frames per millisecond.
Then G = 1/2.
S = G × e−2G = 0.184 (18.4 percent)
This means that
Throughput = 500 × 0.184 = 92
Only 92 frames out of 500 will probably survive
This is the maximum throughput case, percentage-wise.

4. A pure ALOHA network transmits 200-bit frames on a shared channel of 200 kbps. What is the throughput if the system (all stations together) produces 250 frames per second?
a) 38 frames
b) 48 frames
c) 96 frames
d) 126 frames
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: If the system creates 250 frames per second, or 1/4 frames per millisecond, then G = ¼.
S = G × e−2G = 0.152 (15.2 percent).
This means that
Throughput = 250 × 0.152 = 38.
Only 38 frames out of 250 will probably survive.
5. A slotted ALOHA network transmits 200-bit frames using a shared channel with a 200-kbps bandwidth. Find the throughput if the system (all stations together) produces 1000 frames per second.

c) 276 frames
d) 151 frames
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: G =1 S=G×e−G=0.368 (36.8%)
Throughput = 1000 × 0.0368 = 368 frames.

a) 92 frames
b) 368 frames
c) 276 frames
d) 151 frames
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: G=1/2 S = G × e−G = 0.303 (30.3 percent)
Throughput is 500 × 0.0303 = 151.
7. A network using CSMA/CD has a bandwidth of 10 Mbps. If the maximum propagation time (including the delays in the devices and ignoring the time needed to send a jamming signal, as we see later) is 25.6 μs, what is the minimum size of the frame?
a) 128 bytes
b) 32 bytes
c) 16 bytes
d) 64 bytes
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The minimum frame transmission time is Tfr = 2 × Tp = 51.2 μs. This means, in the worst case, a station needs to transmit for a period of 51.2 μs to detect the collision.
The minimum size of the frame is 10 Mbps × 51.2 μs = 512 bits or 64 bytes. This is actually the minimum size of the frame for Standard Ethernet.

4. What is the number of possible 3 x 3 affine cipher transformations ?
a) 168
b) 840
c) 1024
d) 1344
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Since ‘A’ cannot have columns of ‘0’s. so there are ‘7’ choices i.e. 001/010/011/100/101/110/111. ‘a1’ is chosen for first column of ‘A.
We have ‘6’ choices for second column, let ‘a2’ be chosen for second column.
The final column can be any 3-tuple except 0, a1, a2, a1+a2. That means any one of the remaining ‘4’ 3-tuples may be chosen for the final column.
(Total number of@ possibilities for A)}=k=7×6×4=168
(Number of affine@ block cipher transformation)}=k×t=8×168 =1344
5. Super-Encipherment using two affine transformations results in another affine transformation.
a) True
b) False
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: f(g(m))=A_1 g(m)+c_1
f(g(m))=A_1 (A_2 m+c_2)+c_1 f(g(m))=A_1 A_2 m+A_1 c_2+c_1 f(x)=A_3 m+c_3
where
A_3=A_1 A_2
c_3=A_1 c_2+c_1
This results in another affine transformation, and does not improve the security.

4. In an IP packet, the value of HLEN is 5_16 and the value of the total length field is 0028_16. How many bytes of data are being carried by this packet?
a) 10
b) 40
c) 60
d) 20
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Total number of bytes in the header = 5 x 4 = 20 bytes.
Total length = 0028_16 = 40 bytes.
Data carried by the packet = (40 – 20) = 20 bytes.
5. In an IP packet, the value of HLEN is 516 and the value of the total length field is 002816.What is the efficiency of this datagram?
a) 80%
b) 50%
c) 66%
d) 75%
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Total number of bytes in the header = 5 x 4 = 20 bytes.
Total length = 0028_16 = 40 bytes.
Data carried by the packet = (40 – 20) = 20 bytes.
Efficiency = payload length / total length = 20/40= 50%.

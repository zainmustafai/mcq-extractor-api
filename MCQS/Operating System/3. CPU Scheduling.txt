12. Which of the following statements are true? (GATE 2010)

I. Shortest remaining time first scheduling may cause starvation
II. Preemptive scheduling may cause starvation
III. Round robin is better than FCFS in terms of response time
a) I only
b) I and III only
c) II and III only
d) I, II and III
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: I) Shortest remaining time first scheduling is a preemptive version of shortest job scheduling. It may cause starvation as shorter processes may keep coming and a long CPU burst process never gets CPU.
II) Preemption may cause starvation. If priority based scheduling with preemption is used, then a low priority process may never get CPU.
III) Round Robin Scheduling improves response time as all processes get CPU after a specified time.

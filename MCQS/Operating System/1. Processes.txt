4. Messages sent by a process __________
a) have to be of a fixed size
b) have to be a variable size
c) can be fixed or variable sized
d) none of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Messages sent by a process can be fixed or variable size. If the message size of the process is fixed then system level implementation is straightforward but it makes the task of programming more difficult. If the message size of the process is variable then system level implementation is more complex but it makes the task of programming simpler.

2. The number of processes completed per unit time is known as __________
a) Output
b) Throughput
c) Efficiency
d) Capacity
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: The number of processes completed per unit time is known as Throughput. Suppose there are 4 processes A, B, C & D they are taking 1, 3, 4 & 7 units of time respectively for their executions. For 10 units of time, throughput is high if process A, B & C are running first as 3 processes can execute. If process C runs first then throughput is low as maximum only 2 processes can execute. Throughput is low for processes which take a long time for execution. Throughput is high for processes which take a short time for execution.

a) the number of processes executed per unit time
b) the number of processes in the ready queue
c) the number of processes in the I/O queue
d) the number of processes in memory
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Multiprogramming means the number of processes are in the ready states. To increase utilization of CPU, Multiprogramming is one of the most important abilities of OS. Generally, a single process cannot use CPU or I/O at all time, whenever CPU or I/O is available another process can use it. By doing this CPU utilization is increased.

a) only one task at a time
b) multiple tasks at a time
c) only two tasks at a time
d) all of the mentioned
View Answer

9. What is the objective of multiprogramming?
a) Have a process running at all time
b) Have multiple programs waiting in a queue ready to run
c) To increase CPU utilization
d) None of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The objective of multiprogramming is to increase CPU utilization. Generally, a single process cannot use CPU or I/O at all time, whenever CPU or I/O is available another process can use it. Multiprogramming offers this ability to OS by keeping multiple programs in a ready queue.

a) cooperating process
b) child process
c) parent process
d) init process
View Answer

Explanation: A cooperating process can be affected by other processes executing in the system. Also it can affect other processes executing in the system. A process shares data with other processes, such a process is known as a cooperating process.
2. When several processes access the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place is called ________
a) dynamic condition
b) race condition
c) essential condition
d) critical condition
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: When several processes access the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which access takes place is called race condition.
3. If a process is executing in its critical section, then no other processes can be executing in their critical section. What is this condition called?
a) mutual exclusion
b) critical exclusion
c) synchronous exclusion
d) asynchronous exclusion
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: If a process is executing in its critical section, then no other processes can be executed in their critical section. This condition is called Mutual Exclusion. Critical section of the process is shared between multiple processes. If this section is executed by more than one or all of them concurrently then the outcome of this is not as per desired outcome. For this reason the critical section of the process should not be executed concurrently.

4. Which one of the following is a synchronization tool?
a) thread
b) pipe
c) semaphore
d) socket
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Semaphore is a synchronization tool. Semaphore is a mechanism which synchronizes or controls access of threads on critical resources. There are two types of semaphores i) Binary Semaphore ii) Counting Semaphore.
5. A semaphore is a shared integer variable __________
a) that can not drop below zero
b) that can not be more than zero
c) that can not drop below one
d) that can not be more than one
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: A semaphore is a shared integer variable that can not drop below zero. In binary semaphore, if the value of the semaphore variable is zero that means there is a process that uses a critical resource and no other process can access the same critical resource until it is released. In Counting semaphore, if the value of the semaphore variable is zero that means there is no resource available.

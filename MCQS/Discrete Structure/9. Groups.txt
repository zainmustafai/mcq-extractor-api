3. B1: ({0, 1, 2….(n-1)}, xm) where xn stands for “multiplication-modulo-n” and B2: ({0, 1, 2….n}, xn) where xn stands for “multiplication-modulo-m” are the two statements. Both B1 and B2 are considered to be __________
a) groups
b) semigroups
c) subgroups
d) associative subgroup

Explanation: Here, B1 is the group and identity element is 0, means for all a∈B1, a+n.0=a. As a<n. But in B2 identity element does not exist. Here, 0 can not be the identity element. For example, for one of the member n of the set we have n+n.0=0, It will be n. So, B2 is not a group. Both B1 and B2 are semigroups as they satisfy closure and associativity property.

6. Let * be the binary operation on the rational number given by a*b=a+b+ab. Which of the following property does not exist for the group?
a) closure property
b) identity property
c) symmetric property
d) associative property
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: For identity e, a+e=e+a=e, a*e = a+e+ae = a => e=0 and e+a = e+a+ea = a => e=0. So e=0 will be identity, for e to be identity, a*e = a ⇒ a+e+ae = a ⇒ e+ae = 0 and e(1+a) = 0 which gives e=0 or a=-1. So, when a = -1, no identity element exist as e can be any value in that case.

8. A group G, ({0}, +) under addition operation satisfies which of the following properties?
a) identity, multiplicity and inverse
b) closure, associativity, inverse and identity
c) multiplicity, associativity and closure
d) inverse and closure
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Closure for all a, b∈G, the result of the operation, a+b, is also in G. Since there is one element, hence a=b=0, and a+b=0+0=0∈G. Hence, closure property is satisfied. Associative for all a, b, c∈G, (a+b)+c=a+(b+c). For example, a=b=c=0. Hence (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)
⟹(0+0)+0=0+(0+0)⟹0=0. Hence, associativity property is satisfied. Suppose for an element e∈G such that, there exists an element a∈G and so the equation e+a=a+e=a holds. Such an element is unique, the identity element property is satisfied. For example, a=e=0. Hence e+a = a+e⟹0+0=0+0⟹0=a. Hence e=0 is the identity element. For each a∈G, there exists an element b∈G (denoted as a-1), such that a+b=b+a=e, where e is the identity element. The inverse element is 0 as the addition of 0 with 0 will be 0, which is also an identity element of the structure.

Explanation: A nonzero R-module M is irreducible if and only if M is a cyclic module with any nonzero element as its generator. Suppose that M is an irreducible module. Let a∈M be any nonzero element and consider the submodule (a) generated by the element a. Since a is a nonzero element, the submodule (a) is non-zero. Since M is irreducible, this implies that M=(a). Hence M is a cyclic module generated by a. Since a is any nonzero element, the module M is a cyclic module with any nonzero element as its generator.

4. A finite group G of order 219 is __________
a) a semigroup
b) a subgroup
c) a commutative inverse
d) a cyclic group
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The prime factorization 219=3⋅73. By the definition of Sylow’s theorem, determine the number np of Sylow p-group for p=3,73. np≡1(mod p) and np divides n/p. Thus, n3 could be 1, 4, 7, 10, 13,… and n3 needs to divide 219/3=73. Hence the only possible value for n3 is n3=1. So there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P3 of G. By Sylow’s theorem, the unique Sylow 3-subgroup must be a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, n73=1, 74,… and n73 must divide 219/73=3 and hence we must have n73=1. Thus, G has a unique normal Sylow 73-subgroup P73.
5. The number of generators of cyclic group of order 219 is __________
a) 144
b) 124
c) 56
d) 218

Explanation: The number of generators of a cyclic group of order n is equal to the number of integers between 1 and n that are relatively prime to n.Namely, the number of generators is equal to ϕ(n), where ϕ is the Euler totient function. We know that G is a cyclic group of order 219. Hence, the number of generators of G is ϕ(219) = ϕ(3)ϕ(73) = 3⋅73 = 144.

a) a+1=0
b) an = 0, for some positive integer n
c) an = 1, for some integer n
d) a2 = 0
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Since a is nilpotent in a commutative ring R, we have an=0 for some positive integer n. since R is commutative, for any m∈R, we have (am)n=anmn=0. Then we have the following equality: (1−am)(1+(am)+(am)2+⋯+(am)n−1)=1. Hence, 1−am is a unit in R.
10. A group G of order 20 is __________
a) solvable
b) unsolvable
c) 1
d) not determined
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The prime factorization of 20 is 20=2⋅5. Let n5 be the number of 5-Sylow subgroups of G. By Sylow’s theorem, we have, n5≡1(mod 5)and n5|4. Thus, we have n5=1. Let P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G. The subgroup P is normal in G as it is the unique 5-Sylow subgroup. Then consider the subnormal series G▹P▹{e}, where e is the identity element of G. Then the factor groups G/P, P/{e} have order 4 and 5 respectively. Hence these are cyclic groups(in particular abelian). Hence, the group G of order 20 has a subnormal series whose factor groups are abelian groups, and thus G is a solvable group.

Answer: b
Explanation: By cayley hamilton theorem, M4 = 0. So, characteristic equation should be λ*4=0 and after solving we get 0 for every eigen value. Eigen values of (I+M) = Individual Eigen value of 1+m. So all the eigen values of (I+M) are 1 and Det(I+A) = 1.

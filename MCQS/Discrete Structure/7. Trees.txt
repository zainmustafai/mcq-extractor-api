b) m-n
c) m*n
d) m*n+1

2. For an n-vertex undirected graph, the time required to find a cycle is ____________
a) O(n)
b) O(n2)
c) O(n+1)
d) O(logn)
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The existence of a cycle in directed and undirected graphs can be determined by depth-first search (DFS) of the graph finds an edge that points to an ancestor of the current vertex. In an undirected graph, finding any already visited vertex will indicate a back edge. All the back edges which DFS skips over are part of cycles. In the case of undirected graphs, only O(n) time is required to find a cycle in an n-vertex graph, since at most n − 1 edges can be tree edges.

4. If G is a simple graph with n-vertices and n>=3, the condition for G has a Hamiltonian circuit is __________
a) the degree of each vertex is at most n/2
b) the degree of each vertex is equal to n
c) the degree of every vertex is at least n+1/2
d) the degree of every vertex in G is at least n/2

If there is a vertex of degree one in a graph then it is impossible for it to have a Hamiltonian circuit. If G is a simple graph with n-vertices and n>=3 such that the degree of every vertex in G is at least n/2, then G has a Hamiltonian circuit.

b) 36
c) 45
d) 19

a) 6
b) 10
c) 25
d) 7

Answer: d
Explanation: In a cycle of a graph G if we join all the vertices to the centre point, then that graph is called a wheel graph. There is always a Hamiltonian cycle in a wheel graph and there are n2-3n+3 cycles. So, for order 5 the answer should be 7.

a) O(V2)
b) O(V+E-1)
c) O(V+E)
d) O(E+1)
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: An undirected graph has Eulerian Path if the following two conditions are true: -a) All vertices with a non-zero degree are connected. A graph of vertices with zero degrees don’t belong to Eulerian Cycle or Path, b) If two vertices have odd degree and all other vertices have even degree. Thus, the time to find whether a graph has a Eulerian path or not is O(V+E) with V vertices and E edges.

b) Euler Tour traversal
c) Post-order traversal
d) Pre-order Traversal

d) O(n)
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The approach is to traverse the binary tree in any fashion and check if the node is the leaf node(child node)or not. After that, add node data to the sum variable. So, after summing up all leaf nodes, the time complexity of the operation should be O(n).

4. Infix to prefix conversion can be done using __________
a) two queues
b) two stacks
c) one stack and two queues
d) one stack
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: In the infix expression, the operator appears between the operands and in infix notation if the operator appears before the operands in the expression. For the conversion between them two stacks are used efficiently. The idea is to use one stack for operators and other to store operands.
5. Conversion from prefix to postfix expression can be done _______________
a) using bubble sort
b) using radix sort
c) using two queues
d) in a direct manner
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: In a postfix expression, the operators appear after the operands. Conversion from prefix to postfix is done directly which is better than converting the prefix expression in infix and then infix to postfix expression. It gives better efficiency.
6. What is the postfix expression of 9+3*5/(10-4)?
a) 9 3 + * 5 / 10 4 –
b) 9 3 5 + * / 10 4 –
c) 9 3 + 5 * / 10 4 –
d) 9 3 5 * / + 10 – 4
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The expression, 9+3*5/(10-4)
= 9+3*5/(10 4-)
= 9+35/*(10 4-)
= 935/*+(10 4-)
So the output is:9 3 5 / * + 10 4 -.
7. What is the postfix expression of (A+B)-C*(D/E))+F?
a) A B + C D E / * – F +
b) A B C D E + / * F – +
c) A B C + * D E / F + –
d) A B + C – * D E / F +
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The expression is (A+B)-C*(D/E))+F
= (A+B)-C*(DE/)+F
= (A+B)-C*(DE/)F+
= (A+B)-C(DE/)*F+
= (A+B)C(DE/)*-F+
= (AB+)C(DE/)*-F+
So the output is: AB+CDE/*-F+.
8. Convert the following expression into prefix notation.

(g-(f^e/d+c)-ba)
a) ^-/gfed+c-ab
b) -ab/+-ec^dgf
c) -ab-+c/d^efg
d) ab/+-^cde-fg
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Convert it first in postfix notation, we can have
(g-(f^e/d+c)-ba)
= (g-(f^e/dc+)-ba)
= (g-(f^ed/c+)-ba)
= (g-(fe^d/c+)-ba)
= (g-(fe^d/c+)ba-)
= (gfe^d/c+-ba-)
By reversing this expression gives the prefix expression, i.e
-ab-+c/d^efg.
9. What is the postfix expression of the given expression, (2*4-(5+7/3^4)-8)10?
a) 2 4 5 * 7 3 4 ^ / + 8 – – 10
b) 2 4 * ^ 5 7 3 4 / + 8 10 – –
c) 2 4 * 5 7 ^ 3 4 / + – 8 10 –
d) 2 4 * 5 7 3 4 ^ / + – 8 – 10
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: By solving we can have,
(2*4-(5+7/3^4)-8)10
= (2*4-(5+7/34^)-8)10
= (2*4-(5+734^/)-8)10
= (2*4-(5734^/+)-8)10
= (2*45734^/+–8)10
= 2*45734^/+-8-10
= 24*5734^/+-8-10
So the output is: 2 4 * 5 7 3 4 ^ / + – 8 – 10.

a) 14
b) 21
c) 54
d) 37
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Let’s consider the given string is CLEAN, so set of string of length 1 = {C,L,E,A,N} ; cardinality of set = 5 set of string of length 2 = {CL,EE,EA,NN}, set of string of length 3 = {CLE,LEE,EAN}, set of strings of length 4 = {CLEN,LEAN}, set of strings of length 5 = {CLEAN} and set of string of length 0 = {} and we cannot have any substring of length 6 as given string has only 5 length. So total no of substrings are possible = 0 length substring + 1 length substring + 2 length substrings +3 length substrings + 4 length substrings + 5 length substrings = 1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 16 means for 1 length string to n length substrings it will sum of the n natural no from 1 to n.
so 1+2+3+…+n = n(n+1)2 so total no substrings possible = 0 length strings + n(n+1)2 = 1+ [n(n+1)2] so total no of substrings possible in n length string (All length inclusive )= 1 + [n(n+1)2]=8(8+1)2 = 37.

4. How many words that can be formed with the letters of the word ‘SWIMMING’ such that the vowels do not come together? Assume that words are of with or without meaning.
a) 430
b) 623
c) 729
d) 1239
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The word ‘SWIMMING contains 8 letters. Of which, I occurs twice and M occurs twice. Therefore, the number of words formed by this word = 8!2!∗2! = 10080. In order to find the number of permutations that can be formed where the two vowels I and I come together, we group the letters that should come together and consider that group as one letter. So, the letters are S, W, M, M, N, G, (I, I). So, the number of letters are 7 the number of ways in which 7 letters can be arranged is 7! = 5040. In I and I, the number of ways in which I and I can be arranged is 2!. Hence, the total number of ways in which the letters of the ‘SWIMMING’ can be arranged such that vowels are always together are 7!2!∗2! = 5040 ways. The number of words in which the vowels do not come together is = (10080 – 5040) = 5040.

In this example, there are n = 14 identical objects to be distributed among r=10 distinct bins. Using the above formula, the number of possible distributions is 13C9.
8. Suppose that M is the product of k distinct primes. Find the number of ways to write N as the product of positive integers(>1), where the order of terms does not matter.
a) MCN-k
b) NCM
c) N * Bk
d) Bk
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: To solve the problem first find the prime factorization of each term of the product, and place the factors of each term into a box. Then, since N is the product of distinct prime factors, each prime factor appears in a unique box. Since the product of all of these terms is N, each prime factor must be in a box. Conversely, for any arrangement of these n distinct primes into r identical boxes, multiply the primes in a box to create a term and the product of these terms results in N. This establishes the bijection and the number of ways is Bk which is Bell number.
9. How many ways are there to place 7 differently colored toys into 5 identical urns if the urns can be empty? Note that all balls have to be used.
a) 320
b) 438
c) 1287
d) 855
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The problem can be described as distinct objects into any number of identical bins and this number can be found with B7 = ∑S(7,k), where S(7,k) is the number of distributions of 5 distinct objects into k identical non-empty bins, so that S(7,1) = 1, S(7,2) = 63, S(7,3) = 301, S(7,4) = 350 and S(7,5) = 140. These values can be found using the recurrence relation identity for Stirling numbers of the second kind. Thus, B7 = 1 + 63 + 301 + 350 + 140 = 855.
10. Suppose, there are 7 of your friends who want to eat pizza (8 distinct people in total). You order a 16-cut pizza (16 identical slices). How many distributions of pizza slices are there if each person gets at least one slice of pizza?
a) 346
b) 6435
c) 3214
d) 765
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: This problem can be viewed as identical objects distributed into distinct non-empty bins. Using the formula for these kind of distributions n-1Cr-1 = 15C7 = 6435. Thus, there are distributions of the pizza slices.

9. Determine all possibilities for the solution set of a homogeneous system of 6 equations in 5 unknowns.
a) only one
b) zero
c) one or infinitely many
d) finitely many
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Since the system is homogeneous and there are more equations than the number of unknowns, so the possibilities are either a unique solution or infinitely many solutions. However, if the rank r of the system is 5, then it can be a unique solution as well as if r<5, then there are infinitely many solutions.

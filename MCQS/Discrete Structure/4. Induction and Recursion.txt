1. What is the base case for the inequality 7n > n3, where n = 3?
a) 652 > 189
b) 42 < 132
c) 343 > 27
d) 42 <= 431
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: By the principle of mathematical induction, we have 73 > 33 ⇒ 343 > 27 as a base case and it is true for n = 3.
2. In the principle of mathematical induction, which of the following steps is mandatory?

b) inductive reference
c) induction set assumption

View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The hypothesis of Step is a must for mathematical induction that is the statement is true for n = k, where n and k are any natural numbers, which is also called induction assumption or induction hypothesis.
3. For m = 1, 2, …, 4m+2 is a multiple of ________
a) 3
b) 5
c) 6
d) 2
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: For n = 1, 4 * 1 + 2 = 6, which is a multiple of 2. Assume that 4m+2 is true for m=k and so 4k+2 is true based on the assumption. Now, to prove that 4k+2 is also a multiple of 2 ⇒ 4(k+1)+2 ⇒ 2 * 4k – 4k + 6 ⇒ 2*4k+4 – 4k+2 ⇒ 2(4k+2) – 2(2k+1). Here, the first term 2(4k+2) is true as per assumption and the second term 2(4k+2) is must to be a multiple of 2. Hence, 4(k+1)+2 is a multiple of 2. So, by induction hypothesis, (4m+2) is a multiple of 2, for m = 1,2,3,…

4. For any integer m>=3, the series 2+4+6+…+(4m) can be equivalent to ________
a) m2+3
b) m+1
c) mm
d) 3m2+4
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The required answer is m2+3. Now, by induction assumption, we have to prove 2+4+6+…+4(k+1) = (k+1)2+3 also can be true, 2+4+6+…+4(k+1) = 2+4+6+⋯+(4k+4) and by the subsequent steps, we can prove that (m+1)2+3 also holds for m=k. So, it is proved.
5. For every natural number k, which of the following is true?
a) (mn)k = mknk
b) m*k = n + 1
c) (m+n)k = k + 1
d) mkn = mnk
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: In the first step, for k = 1, (mn)1 = m1n1 = mn, hence it is true. Let us assume the statement is true for k = l, Now by induction assumption, (mn)1 = m1n1 is true. So, to prove, (mn)l+1 = ml + 1nl+1, we have (mn)l = mlnl and multiplying both sides by (mn) ⇒ (mn)1(mn)=(m1n1)(mn)
⇒ (mn)l+1 = (mm1)(nn1) ⇒ (mn)l+1 = (ml+1nl+1). Hence, it is proved. So, (mn)k = mknk is true for every natural number k.

6. By induction hypothesis, the series 12 + 22 + 32 + … + p2 can be proved equivalent to ____________
a) p2+27
b) p∗(p+1)∗(2p+1)6
c) p∗(p+1)4
d) p+p2
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: By principle of mathematical induction, we now assume that p (b) is true 12 + 22 + 32 + … + b2 = b(b+1)(2b+1)6
so to prove P(b+1): 12 + 22 + 32 + … + b2 + (b + 1)2 = b(b+1)(2b+1)6 + (b + 1)2
By induction assumption it is shown that 12 + 22 + 32 + … + b2 + (b + 1)2 = (b+1)[(b+2)(2b+3)]6. Hence it is proved that 12 + 22 + 32 + … + p2 = p∗(p+1)∗(2p+1)6.
7. For any positive integer m ______ is divisible by 4.
a) 5m2 + 2
b) 3m + 1
c) m2 + 3
d) m3 + 3m
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The required answer is, m3 + 3m. Now, by induction hypothesis, we have to prove for m=k, k3+3k is divisible by 4. So, (k + 1)3 + 3 (k + 1) = k3 + 3 k2 + 6 k + 4
= [k3 + 3 k] + [3 k2 + 3 k + 4] = 4M + (12k2 + 12k) – (8k2 + 8k – 4), both the terms are divisible by 4. Hence (k + 1)3 + 3 (k + 1) is also divisible by 4 and hence it is proved for any integer m.
8. According to principle of mathematical induction, if P(k+1) = m(k+1) + 5 is true then _____ must be true.
a) P(k) = 3m(k)
b) P(k) = m(k) + 5
c) P(k) = m(k+2) + 5
d) P(k) = m(k)
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: By the principle of mathematical induction, if a statement is true for any number m = k, then for its successor m = k + 1, the statement also satisfies, provided the statement is true for m = 1. So, the required answer is p(k) = mk + 5.

2. ________ is the consequence of dynamic programming.
a) Bellman equation
b) Frobenius equation
c) Linear equation
d) Boolean expression
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Dynamic programming can lead to recursive optimization that can restate a multistep optimization problem in its recursive form. The Bellman equation that writes the value of the optimization problem at an earlier time in terms of its value at a later time is the result of dynamic programming.

a) 6
b) 2
c) 10
d) 4
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: There are two types of self-referential definitions and these are inductive and coinductive definitions. An inductively defined recursive data definition must have to specify how to construct instances of the data. For example, linked lists are defined as an inductively recursive data definition.

4. _______ recursion consists of multiple self-references.
a) binary recursion
b) single recursion
c) multiple recursion
d) coinductive recursion
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: A recursion which consists of multiple self-references and requires exponential time and space is called multiple recursion. Multiple recursions include tree traversal of a graph, such as in a depth-first search. However, single recursion is more efficient than multiple recursion.

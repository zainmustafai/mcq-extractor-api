a) 56
b) 78
c) 49
d) 100
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Let R is an equivalence relation on the set S and so it satisfies the reflexive, symmetric and transitive property. The largest equivalence relation means it should contain the largest number of ordered pairs. Since we can have n2 ordered pairs in R x R where n belongs to S and all these ordered pairs are present in this relation; its the largest equivalence relation.So there are n2 elements i.e 72 = 49 elements in the largest equivalence relation.

Explanation: It is not reflexive as aRa is not possible. It is symmetric as if aRb then bRa. It is not antisymmetric as aRb and bRa are possible and we can have a!=b. It is not transitive as if aRb and bRc then aRc need not be true. This is violated when c=a. So the answer is symmetry property.
7. The number of equivalence relations of the set {3, 6, 9, 12, 18} is ______
a) 4
b) 25
c) 22
d) 90
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Number of equivalence Relations are given by BELL number. The nth of these numbers i.e, Bn counts the number of different ways to partition a set that has exactly n elements, or equivalently, the number of equivalence relations on it. Let’s say, 1 -> Equivalence relation with 1 element; 1 2 -> Equivalence relation with 2 element; 2 3 5 -> Equivalence relation with 3 element; 5 7 10 15 -> Equivalence relation with 4 element. Hence, the answer is 4.
8. Let R1 and R2 be two equivalence relations on a set. Is R1 ∪ R2 an equivalence relation?
a) an equivalence relation
b) reflexive closure of relation
c) not an equivalence relation
d) partial equivalence relation
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: R1 union R2 is not equivalence relation because transitivity property of closure need not hold. For instance, (x, y) can be in R1 and (y, z) be in R2 and (x, z) not in either R1 or R2. However, R1 intersection R2 is an equivalence relation.
9. A relation R is defined on the set of integers as aRb if and only if a+b is even and R is termed as ______
a) an equivalence relation with one equivalence class
b) an equivalence relation with two equivalence classes
c) an equivalence relation
d) an equivalence relation with three equivalence classes
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: R is reflexive as (a+b) is even for any integer; R is symmetric as if (a+b) is even (b+a) is also even; R is transitive as if ((a+b)+c) is even, then (a+(b+c)) is also even.
So, R is an equivalence relation. For set of natural numbers, sum of even numbers always give even, sum of odd numbers always give even and sum of any even and any odd number always give odd. So, must have two equivalence classes -> one for even and one for odd.
{…, -4, -2, 0, 2, … } and {…, -3, -1, 1, 3, … }.

1. The binary relation {(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2)} on the set {1, 2, 3} is __________
a) reflective, symmetric and transitive
b) irreflexive, symmetric and transitive
c) neither reflective, nor irreflexive but transitive
d) irreflexive and antisymmetric
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Not reflexive -> (3,3) not present; not irreflexive -> (1, 1) is present; not symmetric -> (2, 1) is present but not (1, 2); not antisymmetric – (2, 3) and (3, 2) are present; not asymmetric -> asymmetry requires both antisymmetry and irreflexivity. So, it is transitive closure of relation.
2. Consider the relation: R’ (x, y) if and only if x, y>0 over the set of non-zero rational numbers,then R’ is _________
a) not equivalence relation
b) an equivalence relation
c) transitive and asymmetry relation
d) reflexive and antisymmetric relation
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Reflexive: a, a>0
Symmetric: if a, b>0 then both must be +ve or -ve, which means b, a > 0 also exists
Transitive: if a, b>0 and b, c>0 then to have b as same number, both pairs must be +ve or -ve which implies a, c>0. Hence, R’ is an equivalence relation.

4. Let A be a set of k (k>0) elements. Which is larger between the number of binary relations (say, Nr) on A and the number of functions (say, Nf) from A to A?
a) number of relations
b) number of functions
c) the element set
d) number of subsets of the relation
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: For a set with k elements the number of binary relations should be 2(n*n) and the number of functions should be nn. Now, 2(n*n) => n2log (2) [taking log] and nn => nlog (n) [taking log]. It is known that n2log (2) > nlog (n). Hence, the number of binary relations > the number of functions i.e, Nr > Nf.

10. Let R be a relation between A and B. R is asymmetric if and only if ________
a) Intersection of D(A) and R is empty, where D(A) represents diagonal of set
b) R-1 is a subset of R, where R-1 represents inverse of R
c) Intersection of R and R-1 is D(A)
d) D(A) is a subset of R, where D(A) represents diagonal of set
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: A relation is asymmetric if and only if it is both antisymmetric and irreflexive. As a consequence, a relation is transitive and asymmetric if and only if it is a strict partial order. If D(A) is a diagonal of A set and intersection of D(A) and R is empty, then R is asymmetric.

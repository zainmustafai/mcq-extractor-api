9. In transport layer, Multiplexing is done at _________
a) Channel
b) Receiver site
c) Sender site
d) Packet
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: At the sender’s side, there are multiple processes which may want to send packets. But there is only one transport layer protocol like TCP or UDP working at a time. So the transport layer protocol gets the messages from these processes and separates them with different port numbers. This process is called multiplexing and it is done before sending packets to the receivers side.
10. The process of error checking and dropping of the header, delivering messages to appropriate process based on port number is called as _______
a) Delivery of packets
b) Error correction
c) Multiplexing
d) Demultiplexing
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Demultiplexing is the process of error checking and dropping of the header, delivering messages to appropriate process based on port number. The transport layer does this on the receiver’s end after the packet is received and takes help of the header attached by the sender’s side transport layer during multiplexing.

Explanation: We know that the prefix 172 lies in class B (128 to 191) of IPv4 addresses. From the subnet mask, we get that the class is divided into 2 subnets: 172.16.13.0 to 172.16.13.127 and 172.16.13.128 to 172.16.13.255. The IP 172.16.13.5 lies in the first subnet. So the starting address 172.16.13.0 is the subnet address and last address 172.16.13.127 is the broadcast address.
3. If you wanted to have 12 subnets with a Class C network ID, which subnet mask would you use?
a) 255.255.255.252
b) 255.255.255.255
c) 255.255.255.240
d) 255.255.255.248
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: If you have eight networks and each requires 10 hosts, you would use the Class C mask of 255.255.255.240. Why? Because 240 in binary is 11110000, which means you have four subnet bits and four host bits. Using our math, we’d get the following:
24-2=14 subnets
24-2=14 hosts.
4. The combination of _________ and __________ is often termed the local address of the local portion of the IP address.
a) Network number and host number
b) Network number and subnet number
c) Subnet number and host number
d) Host number
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: It is termed as the local address because the address won’t be applicable outside the subnet. Sub networking is implemented for remote sensing in transparent way from that host which is contained in the sub network which called a local operation.

5. _________ implies that all subnets obtained from the same subnet mask.
a) Static subnetting
b) Dynamic subnetting
c) Variable length subnetting
d) Dynamic length subnetting
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Static subnetting is used when the requirement is of same number of hosts in each subnet for the institution. The same subnet mask can be used to find the subnet id of each subnet. It is usually used to divide large networks into smaller parts.

6. State whether true or false.
i) A connection oriented protocol can only use unicast addresses.
ii) The any cast service is included in IPV6.
a) True, True
b) True, False
c) False, True
d) False, False
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: In a connection oriented protocol, the host can only establish connection with another host on one unique channel, that’s why it can only use unicast addresses. In IPv6, there is an anycast address in IPv6 which allows sending messages to a group of devices but not all devices in a network.

Answer: d
Explanation: In computer networking, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE or 1 GigE) is a term describing various technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per second (1,000,000,000 bits per second), as defined by the IEEE 802.3-2008 standard. It came into use beginning in 1999, gradually supplanting Fast Ethernet in wired local networks, as a result of being considerably faster.
9. _________ is a collective term for a number of Ethernet Standards that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 1000 Mbit/s against the original Ethernet speed of 10 Mbit/s.
a) Ethernet
b) Fast Ethernet
c) Gigabit Ethernet
d) Gigabyte Ethernet
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Fast Ethernet is a set of Ethernet Standards which were introduced in 1995, that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 1000 Mbit/s. 100BASE-TX is the most commonly used Fast Ethernet standard.
10. _________ is another kind of fiber optic network with an active star for switching.
a) S/NET
b) SW/NET
c) NET/SW
d) FS/NET
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: A 50-MBd active star fiber optical Local area network (LAN) and its optical combiner and mixing rod splitter are presented. The limited power budget and relatively large tapping losses of light wave technology, which limit the use of fiber optics in tapped bus LAN topologies, are examined and proven tolerable in optical star topologies.

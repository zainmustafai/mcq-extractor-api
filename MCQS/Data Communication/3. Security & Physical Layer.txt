1. Physical or logical arrangement of network is __________
a) Topology
b) Routing
c) Networking
d) Control
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Topology in networks is the structure or pattern in which each and every node in the network is connected. There are many topologies in networking like bus, tree, ring, star, mesh, and hybrid topology. There is no particular best topology and a suitable topology can be chosen based on the kind of application of the network .
2. Which network topology requires a central controller or hub?
a) Star
b) Mesh
c) Ring
d) Bus
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: In star topology, no computer is connected to another computer directly but all the computers are connected to a central hub. Every message sent from a source computer goes through the hub and the hub then forwards the message only to the intended destination computer.
3. _______ topology requires a multipoint connection.
a) Star
b) Mesh
c) Ring
d) Bus
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: In bus topology, there is a single cable to which all the network nodes are connected. So whenever a node tries to send a message or data to other nodes, this data passes through all other nodes in the network through the cable. It is really simple to install but it’s not secure enough to be used in most of the computer network applications.

7. In TDM, slots are further divided into __________
a) Seconds
b) Frames
c) Packets
d) Bits
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: TDM is the abbreviation for Time division multiplexing. It is technique for combining several low rate channels to a single high rate channel. For a certain time slot, the several channels could use the maximum bandwidth. Each channel is inactive for a period of time too. Some other multiplexing techniques are Frequency division multiplexing and Phase division multiplexing.
8. _____ is the multiplexing technique that shifts each signal to a different carrier frequency.
a) FDM
b) TDM
c) Both FDM & TDM

4. If there are n signal sources of same data rate, then the TDM link has _______ slots.
a) n
b) n/2
c) n*2
d) 2n
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: In TDM, the total unit of time is divided equally among all the signal sources and each and every source has access to the complete channel bandwidth during its allotted time slot. When the time slot of the source is not active, it remains idle and waits for its slot to begin.
5. If link transmits 4000frames per second, and each slot has 8 bits, the transmission rate of circuit this TDM is _________
a) 32kbps
b) 500bps
c) 500kbps
d) 32bps
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Transmission rate= frame rate * number of bits in a slot.
Given: Frame rate = 4000/sec and number of bits in slot = 8
Thus, Transmission rate = (4000 * 8) bps
= 32000bps
= 32kbps

7. Multiplexing provides _________
a) Efficiency
b) Privacy
c) Anti jamming
d) Both Efficiency & Privacy
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Multiplexing helps us to transfer our messages over a shared channel. This brings up the issue of privacy and efficiency. Fortunately, Multiplexing has high efficiency and high privacy when implemented because in the implementation, the transport layer of the OSI network model handles the function of multiplexing through interfaces called ports which provide the required efficiency and privacy.

a) Greater than
b) Lesser than
c) Equal to
d) Equal to or greater than
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: In TDM the transmission rate provided by the path that is multiplexed will always be greater than the sum of transmission rates of the single sources. This happens because the transmission rate is provided to each source only for a small period of time.

2. Which of the following is a form of DoS attack?
a) Vulnerability attack
b) Bandwidth flooding
c) Connection flooding
d) All of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: In a DoS attack, the attacker won’t let the victims access the network by using a certain method that ensures that an essential network resource is unavailable to the victim. In vulnerability attack, the attacker exploits any obvious vulnerable entity in the network to deny the victim access into the network. In bandwidth flooding, the attacker floods the victim with a huge flow of packets and uses up all the bandwidth. In connection flooding, the attacker floods the victim network with a huge number of connections, so that, no other machine can connect to it.
3. The DoS attack, in which the attacker establishes a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections at the target host is ________
a) Vulnerability attack
b) Bandwidth flooding
c) Connection flooding
d) UDP flooding
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In Vulnerability attack, the attacker exploits the vulnerable control points of the network to deny access to the victims. In Bandwidth flooding, the attacker intentionally uses up all the bandwidth by flooding the victim with a deluge of packets and makes sure that the victim can’t use any bandwidth. In UDP flooding, too many UDP packets are sent by the attacker to the victim at random ports.

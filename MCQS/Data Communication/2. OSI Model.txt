6. When 2 or more bits in a data unit has been changed during the transmission, the error is called ____________
a) random error
b) burst error
c) inverted error
d) double error
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: When a single bit error occurs in a data, it is called single bit error. When more than a single bit of data is corrupted or has error, it is called burst error.
